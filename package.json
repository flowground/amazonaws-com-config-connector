    "description": "AWS Config AWS Config provides a way to keep track of the configurations of all\nthe AWS resources associated with your AWS account. You can use AWS Config to\nget the current and historical configurations of each AWS resource and also to\nget information about the relationship between the resources. An AWS resource\ncan be an Amazon Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance, an Elastic Block Store\n(EBS) volume, an elastic network Interface (ENI), or a security group. For a\ncomplete list of resources currently supported by AWS Config, see Supported AWS\nResources\n[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/resource-config-reference.html#supported-resources]\n.\n\nYou can access and manage AWS Config through the AWS Management Console, the AWS\nCommand Line Interface (AWS CLI), the AWS Config API, or the AWS SDKs for AWS\nConfig. This reference guide contains documentation for the AWS Config API and\nthe AWS CLI commands that you can use to manage AWS Config. The AWS Config API\nuses the Signature Version 4 protocol for signing requests. For more information\nabout how to sign a request with this protocol, see Signature Version 4 Signing\nProcess [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html]\n. For detailed information about AWS Config features and their associated\nactions or commands, as well as how to work with AWS Management Console, see \nWhat Is AWS Config\n[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/WhatIsConfig.html] in\nthe AWS Config Developer Guide.",
